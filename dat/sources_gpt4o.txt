        csimpánz (from "chimpanzee", through scientific taxonomy)
        koefficiens (from "coefficient")

        birs (a bit different, from Turkish through regional trade)

These groupings are approximations and can intersect due to overlapping influences and the way words may have re-entered the language with new nuances or via different intermediaries.
